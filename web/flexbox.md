# Flexbox
Flexbox is a concept used to design responsive pages.
* Enable flex with the `display: flex;` CSS property.
  * e.g. allows two divs to be placed on the same row

## Making a row or column
* The property `flex-direction` applied to a parent element allows for any children to be *row or column* aligned
  * `flex-direction: row;` - think of likes/retweets/replies row on twitter
  * `flex-direction: column;` - think of how the profile name and @ handle are stacked on twitter
