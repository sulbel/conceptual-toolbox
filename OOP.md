# What is OOP?

Object-oriented programming combines a group of variables (properties) and functions (methods) into a unit called an "object." These objects are organized into classes where individual objects can be grouped together. OOP can help you consider objects in a program's code and the different actions that could happen in relation to the objects.



# Main Concepts

## **Encapsulation**
* Encapsulation is a way to bundle data with the methods that interact with the data
  * Gives rise to `getter` and `setter` methods
* Data inside an object should only be accessible via a *public interface*
* Bad practice to retrieve the object's information and perform an action outside of the object

Encapsulation should be used for several reasons:
* functionality is defined in one place instead of several places
* defined in a logical place - where the data exists
* data inside the object is not modified unexpectantly by outside code
* can use the same method on several, differently-valued objects
