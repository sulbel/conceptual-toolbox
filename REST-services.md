REST has quickly become the de-facto standard for building web services on the web because they're easy to build and easy to consume.

# Why REST?
REST embraces the precepts of the web, including its architecture, benefits, and everything else.  The web and its core protocol, HTTP, provide a stack of features:
* Suitable actions such as `GET` `POST` `PUT` `DELETE`
* Caching
* Redirection and forwarding
* Security measures such as encryption and authentication

By building on top of HTTP, REST APIs provide the means to build:
* Backwards compatible APIs
* Evolvable APIs
* Scaleable services
* Securable services
* A spectrum of stateless to stateful services

REST is not a standard, per se, but **an approach**, a style, a set of constraints on your architecture that can help you build web-scale systems.
