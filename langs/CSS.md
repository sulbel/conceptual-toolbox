# CSS

## Inline Styling
A technique where one places `style=""` inline with the HTML
  * This only applies to the single element that is styled

## Styling by selectors
A better approach is to use a `style` block at the top of your HTML codr
  * This will style **all** elements specified
```
<style>
  h2 {
      color: blue;
  }
</style>
```
