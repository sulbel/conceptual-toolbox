# CSS

## Inline Styling
A technique where one places `style=""` inline with the HTML
  * This only applies to the single element that is styled

## Styling by selectors
A better approach is to use a `style` block at the top of your HTML codr
  * This will style **all** elements specified
```
<style>
  h2 {
      color: blue;
  }
</style>
```

## Classes
Reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements
  * Instead of specifying a selector for an HTML element, declare a class
  * Class names **begin with a .**
  * Apply classes to elements with the `class=""` tag. Note that the . is not needed inside the element class attribute
  * Classes allow you to use the same CSS styles on multiple HTML elements

## `id` Attribute
Each HTML element can also have an `id` attribute
  * Can use `id` to style a **single** element
  * Can use the `id` element to select and modify specific elements with JavaScript
  * Best practice to keep `id` unique; do not give more than 1 element the same `id`
  * Like classes, can style an element based on `id`
    * However, `id` takes precedence over `class` -> if both are applied with conflicting styles, the `id` styling will be applied
    * `id` style is referenced with `#` instead of `.`
