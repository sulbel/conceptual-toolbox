# Python
Python is a dynamically typed, interpreted language

## Access Modifiers
Python classes have 3 flavors of access modifiers for classes: `public` `protected` and `private`.
* `public` by default, all data members and member functions of a class are public, and accessible from outside the class
* `protected` members are declared by prepending a single `_` and are only accessible to derived classes
* `private` members are declared by prepending a double `__` and are only accessible within the class they are declared
