# Puppet

## Infrastructure as Code
* Clicking through GUI screens to spin up new VMs can be time consuming
* This led to tools like Terraform, Vagrant being introduced to automatically provision new servers in the cloud by means of writing configuration code (IaC)
  * Tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet allow us to automate the configuration and maintanence of these servers
* Particularly useful for scaling out e.g. when the application traffic explodes and the need for new load balancers/application servers arises
